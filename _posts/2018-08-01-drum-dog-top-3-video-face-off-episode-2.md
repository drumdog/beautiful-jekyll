So in the last blog I challenged my fellow Drum Dog, Nick Hartland, to choose his top three drum videos on YouTube.  Now it’s my turn...

### Number 3 - Ian Paice

My first choice is a bit of a cheeky one because it was myself who uploaded it. It was back in the day before they stopped you whipping your phone out and filming drum clinics and I have to say my footage was much better than the official video and was more successful. In 2012 Pearl produced a limited run of drum kits for the 40th anniversary of Deep Purple's Machine Head album. The event was less of a clinic but a product demonstration of the kit and was hosted by the sadly now closed Drumwright shop. Because it wasn’t a clinic it’s clear that this wasn’t a carefully structured solo but rather an absolute legend of rock just having a little bit of spontaneous fun.

### Number 2 - Chad Smith with the Buddy Rich Orchestra

When compiling this list I knew that Chad Smith playing in the Buddy Rich Orchestra had to be included but the song I wanted to share with you 'Birdland' seems to have disappeared from YouTube so instead here is the orchestra playing a Red Hot Chili Peppers song from the same concert.

### Number 1 - Dave Weckl and Jay Oliver - Higher Ground feat. Chris Coleman

So my number one choice is one that always puts a smile on my face when I watch it because it’s a completely and fabulously over the top monster of an arrangement.
