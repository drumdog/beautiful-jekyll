This week during the lockdown I find myself just wandering between editing Drum Dog content and practicing on the electric kit and pad. So I thought I’d share a quick little update on what’s happening on our YouTube channel during these tough times. Luckily, we had stockpiled content to share with you over the next couple of months.

As so many of us are stuck at home with just a practice pad to keep us playing, Nick has prepared a series of short practice pad exercise videos to keep us all going. Speaking of pad exercises we recently filmed a whole lesson pack with our friend and drummer for Nile Rogers and Chic, Ralph Rolle. This pack will be available later in the year, but we will be uploading one of the lessons to YouTube soon as one of our isolation exercises.

We have some gear videos in the pipeline too, including a visit to a local drum builder. He produces some amazing instruments in his workshop so keep an eye out for part one of that story coming soon.

A big thanks for supporting the Drum Dog channel and we will carry on uploading great drum video content for you all to enjoy. Stay safe.
